# Efficient Data Stream Anomaly Detection

## Project Description
This Python script implements an efficient algorithm for detecting anomalies in a continuous data stream. The data stream is simulated as a real-time sequence of floating-point numbers representing various metrics. Anomalies to detect include unusually high values, breaks in patterns, or deviations from the expected norm.

## Objectives
1. **Algorithm Selection:** Utilize the Isolation Forest algorithm for anomaly detection, capable of handling concept drift and seasonality.
2. **Data Stream Simulation:** Simulate a data stream with a pattern, seasonal component, and noise.
3. **Anomaly Detection:** Implement real-time anomaly detection as the data stream is processed.
4. **Optimization:** Optimize the algorithm for speed and efficiency.
5. **Visualization:** Provide a real-time visualization of the data stream and detected anomalies.
